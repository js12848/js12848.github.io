      <h2>Web response to <em>The Social Dilemma</em></h2>
      <p class="week-hero-text">
        I am very caught up to the part where in the film it mentioned that the AI 
        and technology of Big Data has made all Personalized page for every single of us 
        to view the product they think we liked to view which is based on calculation
        and you are rarely stepping outside the circle to know those content that aren't 
        being calculate to fit you.

          <li>
            Making the user to notice that this is a "personlized" web page

        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Adding a custom “refresh” button taught me something: no one uses it, '
            because the browser refresh is already hard-wired into us.
            Even small UI choices reveal how strongly platforms shape our habits.
            In the future I will definitely put more user design thinking when making the page.
