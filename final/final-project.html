      <h2>A page that reflects how we already use the web</h2>
      <p class="week-hero-text">
        This project is a single-page experience that mirrors the small habits we carry online:
        scrolling too fast, hovering for cues, and reloading without thinking.

        <h3>Ideas</h3>
        <p>
          The page begins clean and minimal. As the user interacts, subtle responses appear:
          scroll speed affects clarity, notification react to hovering, and small
          messages respond to reloading. Nothing is saved or personalized, but the site behaves
          like it notices what you do.

        <h3>Why this project</h3>
        <p>
          After watching <em>The Social Dilemma</em> and <em>The Antisocial Network</em>,
          I revisited my own projects and realized how automatic my online behaviors have become.
          This made me question what I now overlook, expect, or perform without thinking.
          <strong>Habit Mirror</strong> is a way to expose those patterns through simple,
          readable interactions.

        <h3>Key interactions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Scroll-based effects: scrolling too fast causes text to blur or fade, showing how speed
            changes what we actually see.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hover-triggered “notifications” that briefly appear, referencing how platforms pull our
            attention with tiny signals.
          </li>
          <li>
            A subtle reaction when the user refreshes the page, highlighting the habit.
          </li>

        <h3>How I’ll build it</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML and a simple, intentional layout.</li>
          <li>Lightweight JavaScript that listens for scroll, hover, and refresh behaviors.</li>
          <li>A short explanation tying the interactions back to platform habits and attention.</li>
